                            <p> This work is motivated by the fairness concerns in public health settings. Recently several algorithmic solutions have been deployed in order to improve the effectiveness of interventions (e.g., HIV, substance abuse and suicide prevention) that leverage social network data to make recommendations. We show that individuals' position in the social network impacts how much they benefit from these interventions. In particular, bigger communities receive disproportionately more benefits that minorities. We extend methods from Opeorations Research and Welfare Economics to address different aspects of this problem.

                            <p> Several social, behaviorial and public health interventions,such as suicide/HIV prevention or community preparedness against natural disasters, rely on social influence to spread and reinforce positive behavior. In particular, I have worked

                            <p> The field of influence maximization (IM) has made rapid advances, resulting in many sophisticated algorithms for identifying “influential” members in social networks. 
				    However, in order to engender trust in IM algorithms, the rationale behind their choice of “influential” nodes needs to be explained to its users. 
				    In this work, we aimed to tackle this open problem by proposing a general paradigm for designing explanations for IM algorithms by exploiting the tradeoff between explanation accuracy and interpretability. 
				    Our paradigm treats IM algorithms as black boxes. We utilize this paradigm to build XplainIM, a suite of explanation systems. We tested the usability of XplainIM by explaining solutions among more then 200 human subjects on Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT). 
				    In particular, our results demonstrate the importance of exploiting the accuracy-interpretability tradeoff in ensuring the intelligibility of our explanations.

                            <p> Multiagent systems can be used in complex tasks to improve performance in terms of both speed and effectiveness. However, use of multi-agent systems poses important challenges. Specifically, in domains where the agents' actions are tightly coupled, i.e., each agents action has a significant impact on other agents' rewards, achieving cooperative behavior at the group level is extremely difficult. In such cases, learning policies can greatly benefit from reward shaping. In this work, I developed a reward function using the notion of counterfactuals to tackle the reward shaping problem in these tightly coupled multi-agent tasks.
